Repo for my implementation of the 'Monkey' language from Thorsten Ball's 'Writing An Interpreter In Go'. The purpose was to learn Go and cover both a particularly interesting and somewhat common University-level CS topic in interpreters/compilers. 

It would be cool to continue using this language & extending it for continued use as I explore other topics, perhaps eventually handing parsing off to a parser generator to ensure correctness.

Once most of the project has been implemented, I plan to add a few things not covered in the book:

- Unicode
- More Numeric types than just Int
- Further n-char identifiers such as Go's ':=', '</=', '>/='
- Regex (using Go's re package)

I will find a suitable point to jump into 'Writing A Compiler In Go' after learning more & considering the friction of the extensions vs progressing through the books.

I'm also curious about attempting to add macros but we'll see how far I get...
